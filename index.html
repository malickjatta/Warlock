    <p id="tribute-link">Ermias Joseph Asghedom[1] (August 15, 1985 â€“ March 31, 2019), known professionally as Nipsey Hussle (often stylized as Nipsey Hu$$le), was an American rapper and songwriter from Los Angeles, California. Emerging from the West Coast hip hop scene in the mid-2000s, Hussle initially became known for his numerous mixtapes, including his Bullets Ain't Got No Name series, The Marathon, The Marathon Continues and Crenshaw, the last of which rapper Jay-Z bought 100 copies of for $100 each.[2] After much delay, his debut studio album Victory Lap was released in February 2018 to critical acclaim and commercial success,[3][4][5][6] and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards in 2019.[7]

Hussle was murdered outside his store, Marathon Clothing, in South Los Angeles on March 31, 2019.[8
